Art image classification with CNNs (fine tuning and transfer learning) (Rijksmuseum Challenge 2014)

Download the data from: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Rijksmuseum_Challenge_2014/5660617

First run the Art_classification_data_load.py for separating train/test/validation sets and choose the N artists with the most number of artworks.

Then, run the Art_classification_train to fine tune a pretrained ResNet or Inception for art image classification.
